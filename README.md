# SRC Arduino

The Solar Car side of the SRC Telemetry System.

This code is written for the Arduino Uno and is used to relay data from the solar car to the chase car.

Platform IO is used to compile and upload the code to the Arduino.

## Quick Start

1. Install [Platform IO Core](https://platformio.org/)
2. Install Platform IO CLion Plugin 
3. Clone this repository
4. Open the project in CLion
6. Connect the Arduino to your computer
7. Upload the code to the Arduino

## Monitoring
To monitor the serial output of the Arduino, use the `pio device monitor` command in the terminal.
